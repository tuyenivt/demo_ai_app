  model: "en_core_sci_md"             # Use a medical spaCy model for loading the spaCy language model
- name: SpacyTokenizer                # Tokenizes the input text into individual words or tokens
- name: SpacyFeaturizer               # Extracts features from tokens using spaCy, such as word vectors and POS tags
- name: RegexFeaturizer               # Uses regular expressions to identify and extract patterns in the text
- name: LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer    # Adds lexical (word-level) and syntactic (sentence structure) features for better intent classification
- name: CountVectorsFeaturizer        # Creates bag-of-words features by counting word occurrences in the text
- name: DIETClassifier                # Uses a Deep Intent Entity Transformer model to classify intents and entities
  epochs: 100                         # Number of training epochs; controls how many times the model iterates over the data for learning (higher values can improve accuracy but may overfit)
  constrain_similarities: true        # Enforces constraints on similarity calculations to make the model more robust and efficient
- name: EntitySynonymMapper           # Maps synonyms of entities to a standard form for better entity recognition
- name: ResponseSelector              # Selects the most appropriate response from a set of predefined responses based on the intent and entities
  epochs: 100                         # Number of training epochs specifically for the response selection model
- name: FallbackClassifier            # Uses a fallback classifier to handle intents that are not covered by the other components
  threshold: 0.3                      # Confidence threshold for classifying intents; if confidence is below this value, it falls back to a default action

policies:
- name: MemoizationPolicy             # Remembers exact previous conversation states for quick matching of intents
- name: RulePolicy                    # Applies predefined rules from the rules.yml file to handle specific conversation patterns
- name: TEDPolicy                     # Uses a Tree-Ensemble Decision Tree model to classify intents and entities
  max_history: 5                      # Maximum number of previous turns in the conversation to consider for decision-making
  epochs: 100                         # Number of training epochs for this policy; affects how well it learns from conversation data
